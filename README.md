// exp_1:
// S1: Load 0x80000 to X1 register using the MOV instruction.
// S2: Load 16 to X3 register using the MOV instruction.
// S3: Read the value of the address from X1 register, write the value to X0, using the LDR instruction.
// S4: Read the value of the address + 8 from X1 register, write the value to X2, using the LDR instruction.
// S5: Read the values of the address from X1 register adding the value of the address in X3 register, write the value to X4.
// S6: Samely, read the (X1+X3<<3), write to the X5 register.
